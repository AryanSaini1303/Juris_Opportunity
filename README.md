## üöÄ How it Works

The AI Drive-Through Optimization system works by analyzing traffic signal data and calculating the optimal speed to avoid red lights. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Data Collection:** The system collects real-time traffic signal data, including the status (green/red) and timings of traffic lights.
2. **Machine Learning Analysis:** Using machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest Regressor), the system analyzes historical and real-time data to predict when a vehicle will encounter a red light.
3. **Speed Optimization:** Based on these predictions, the system recommends an optimal driving speed that allows the vehicle to reach the next intersection while the light is green, reducing the need to stop.
4. **Real-Time Updates:** The system continuously monitors the vehicle's location and adjusts recommendations as the driver moves, ensuring the best possible outcome throughout the journey.
5. **User Interface:** Drivers receive real-time suggestions on their vehicle‚Äôs speed to help them avoid delays caused by traffic signals.

This approach not only improves driving efficiency but also contributes to reducing traffic congestion and lowering carbon emissions, making it a sustainable solution for modern urban environments.
